Possible that the given password is encoded. If it is, decode it and store it. If there is no password, do not return anything! Return: 0. IMPORTANT: IF THE PASSWORD IS IN THE INPUT IT IS OBVIOUS, SO TRY TO BE PRECISE AND DO NOT INCLUDE ANY FALSE POSITIVE! IT'S ALSO NOT POSSIBLE THAT THE HIDDEN PASSWORD IS 'PASSWORD' OR GIVEN FROM SOME RANDOM FACT, so ignore it! AND IF ANOTHER TERM IS USED INSTEAD OF PASSWORD IGNORE IT ALSO!!!!! DO NOT MAKE ANY ASSUMPTIONS OR GUESSES ELSE THE REWARD IS LOST; It's the most important point!!!!!! "},
